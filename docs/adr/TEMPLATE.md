<!--
  An architecture decision record. Copied into a target repo as docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md.

  Write one ONLY when the decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, or a real
  trade-off. A record of an obvious choice is noise, and noise is what stops people reading the
  records that matter.

  No YAML frontmatter, deliberately: this template is stamped into ANOTHER repo, where it is a
  source file read by developers and agents — not a note filed in this vault graph. The vault
  templates beside it all carry frontmatter; these three are the exception, and the reason is here
  rather than inferred from their absence.

# {{NNNN}}. {{Decision, as a statement — "Use X for Y", not "Choosing a Y"}}

**Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
**Status:** {{proposed | accepted | superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)}}

## Context

{{What forced a decision. The constraint, the pressure, what was already true. Someone reading
this in a year should understand the pressure without having been there.}}

## Decision

{{What was decided, stated plainly and in the present tense.}}

## Alternatives rejected

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| {{option}} | {{the actual reason — cost, risk, a constraint it violated}} |

This table is the point of the record. Without it, the decision gets re-litigated by the next
person who has the same idea.

## Consequences

{{What this makes easy, and what it makes hard. Include the cost you are accepting — a record
that lists only benefits is a sales pitch, not a decision.}}
